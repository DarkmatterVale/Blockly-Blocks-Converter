# CodeBlocks
Spin, C, and Forth program converter that generates blocks for BlocklyProp

# Introduction
----------------

CodeBlocks uses Python to convert Spin, C, or Forth files into .js files that contain the blocks inside of the Spin files, just converted to be usable inside of Blockly.

To build, you will need:
- Python

Once you have installed all required dependencies, just navigate to this directory in terminal and type "python convertFile.py". This will open a GUI where you can choose which file you would like to convert. The converted file will then be saved inside of the conversions directory.
