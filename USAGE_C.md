# How to use ( C )

To use the C converter, nothing but your code is required. It is as simple as saving your code to a file, and importing that file's contents using the menu bar. There are, however, some optional comments that you can put in your code to help guide the program and give a some preferences.

These options allow you to configure the converter to generate your blocks the way you would like them generated. Below outlines the possible options that can be edited via comments in your code.

- Changing the category of a block
- Changing the name of a block
- Removing a variable
- Adding a variable
